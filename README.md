# Reminders Plus
A reminder application that uses Calendar Based Reminders to improve overall apathy towards chores!

THIS IS A VIBE CODED APPLICATION!!!!!
I'm purely curious in how "good" Artificial intelligence can get with creating applications. 

Yes I do know how to code, My Languages i'm good in are Java, The full WebStack (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript), Python, C++, and Shell (thanks work :| ). This is mostly going to be written in swift as a result (cause i have no fricken clue)  

Yes, Apple has Reminders and Calendar already coupled together...

Yes, it's redundant, and i have better and cooler things to be doing (don't worry i am doing those as well)

I will periodically update releases with relevant information on AI used via which tool
